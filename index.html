    <!-- Having these two files linked to this html file makes it possible for questions.js and logic.js to share their contents with one another.  -->

    <!-- 
          Notes on the js files:

    - Break the code up into functions:

        - Start the quiz (which of the below functions can be called when we start the quiz?)

        - Get Question and display it on the page 
            - Grabbing the question from the questions array inside of questions.js file. 
            - These get displayed in the choices div.
            - What happens when each choice has been clicked?         
                - Need to display feedback: lets the user know if it was answered correctly or incorrectly. 
                - Also, need to play a sound effect if it is right or wrong. There is a folder with two different sound effects inside. 
                The Audio needs to be imported into logic.js:                  
                var sfxRight = new Audio("assets/sfx/correct.wav");
                var sfxWrong = new Audio("assets/sfx/incorrect.wav");
                
                Example of how to call:
                sfxWrong.play();
                - If the user answers incorrectly then time is taken off of the timer
        
        - End the Quiz
          - what needs to happen here? 
            - Display high scores
            - Stop the timer
    
        - function to handle saving the high score
          - make sure to add the final score to local storage
